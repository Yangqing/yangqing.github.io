<p>I am currently a Research Lead and Manager at Facebook, where I lead a team of talented researchers and engineers to build the general-purpose, large-scale AI platform for all Facebook's applications. The system serves as the backbone of Facebook AI products, such as ranking, computer vision, natural language processing, speech recognition, mobile AI, and AR.</p>

<p>Before Facebook, I was a research scientist at Google Brain, where I worked on computer vision, deep learning, and the TensorFlow framework.</p>

<p>I obtained my Ph.D. in Computer Science at UC Berkeley, advised by Prof. <a href="http://eecs.berkeley.edu/~trevor/">Trevor Darrell</a>. During my graduate study I've worked/interned at the National University of Singapore, Microsoft Research Asia, NEC Labs America, and Google Research. I obtained my bachelor and master degrees from Tsinghua University, China.</p>

<p>I have a track record of creating and contributing to open source libraries. In particular, I have been an active figure in the recent years' AI software stack designs: I am the creator of <a href="http://caffe.berkeleyvision.org/">Caffe</a>, which is now a <a href="http://bvlc.eecs.berkeley.edu/">BVLC</a> maintained, open-source deep learning framework. I've worked on the <a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/">TensorFlow</a> project at Google Brain.Recently, I have created and led the <a href="https://caffe2.ai/">Caffe2</a> and <a href="http://onnx.ai/">ONNX</a> efforts. Caffe2 is one of the first deep learning frameworks to simultaneously provide high-performance AI capability on all major platforms (Cloud CPU/GPU, mobile CPU/GPU, embedded systems, etc.), and ONNX is an open standard for neural networks across the industry, creating collaboration among major players such as Facebook, Microsoft, Amazon, Qualcomm, ARM, and many more. Although I code less nowadays, I still serve as a humble contributor to the open source community with full heart.</p>

<p>My major interest is on the design and evolution of AI hardware and software stack, joining the cutting edge research with the conventional wisdom of computer science. Solutions I created have been widely adopted by the industry, some serving as the de-facto standard of various hardware and software.</p>
