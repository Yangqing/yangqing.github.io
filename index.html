<p>
I am currently a research scientist at Facebook, where I lead the effort of building a general, large-scale platform for the many AI applications at Facebook. Previously, I was a research scientist at Google Brain where I worked on computer vision, deep learning and TensorFlow.
</p>
<p>
I obtained my Ph.D. in Computer Science at UC Berkeley, advised by Prof. <a href="http://eecs.berkeley.edu/~trevor/">Trevor Darrell</a>. During my graduate study I've worked/interned at the National University of Singapore, Microsoft Research Asia, NEC Labs America, and Google Research. I obtained my bachelor and master degrees from Tsinghua University, China.</p>
<p>
I am the author of <a href="http://caffe.berkeleyvision.org/">Caffe</a>, which is now a <a href="http://bvlc.eecs.berkeley.edu/">BVLC</a> maintained, open-source deep learning framework. I've worked on the <a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/">TensorFlow</a> project at Google Brain.
